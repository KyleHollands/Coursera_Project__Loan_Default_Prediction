# Coursera_Project__Loan_Default_Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan default at the time of application. The initial iteration achieved an accuracy of 73%, placing in the 63rd percentile based on the ROC-AUC evaluation.

- Conducted data preprocessing including cleaning, encoding, correlation analysis, variance thresholding, and feature selection using RFECV (Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation).
- Implemented logistic regression as the initial predictive model to handle the binary target variable (Default: Yes/No).
- Planned next steps include feature engineering to combine or refactor variables for improved predictive power and hyperparameter tuning post-RFECV to enhance model performance.Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan default at the time of application.
